# File Dialog Fix for WSL/Linux

## Problem
When running the Bevy editor in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), the native file dialog fails with errors:
```
ERROR rfd::backend::xdg_desktop_portal: Failed to pick folder: Portal request failed
ERROR rfd::backend::xdg_desktop_portal: Failed to pick folder with zenity: Permission denied
```

This is because WSL doesn't have the necessary display server components for native file dialogs.

## Solution Implemented

We've added a **fallback manual path entry system** that automatically activates when file dialogs fail.

### Features Added

1. **Automatic Fallback**: When the file dialog fails (common in WSL), the UI automatically shows a manual path entry field
2. **Manual Entry Button**: Added a "‚úè Manual" button to explicitly switch to manual entry mode
3. **Path Validation**: Real-time validation shows if the path exists and is valid
4. **Create & Use**: Option to create directories that don't exist yet
5. **Helpful Tips**: Contextual tips for WSL users explaining the issue

### Usage

#### Opening a Project
1. Click "üìÇ Open Existing Project"
2. If the dialog fails, you'll see a text input field
3. Enter your project path (e.g., `/home/user/projects/my_game`)
4. Click "Use This Path" or "Create & Use"

#### Creating a New Project
1. Click "üìÅ Create New Project"
2. Enter your project name
3. Click "Browse..." for the location
4. If it fails, you'll see manual entry
5. You can also click "‚úè Manual" to enter the path directly

### Example Paths

```bash
# Home directory projects
/home/your_username/projects/my_game

# Current directory
/home/your_username/dev/bevy/my_project

# WSL accessing Windows files (slower, not recommended for development)
/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/my_game
```

### System-Level Fix (Optional)

If you want to try fixing the native dialogs (may not work in all WSL setups):

```bash
# Install XDG Desktop Portal
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-gtk

# Install Zenity (fallback dialog)
sudo apt install zenity

# Note: This requires X11 or Wayland display server running
```

However, the manual entry fallback is more reliable and doesn't require system modifications.

## Files Modified

- `crates/bevy_editor_project/src/file_dialog_helper.rs` - New helper module
- `crates/bevy_editor_project/src/project_wizard.rs` - Updated to use fallback
- `crates/bevy_editor_project/src/project_manager.rs` - Updated to use fallback
- `crates/bevy_editor_project/src/lib.rs` - Added module export

## Technical Details

The implementation uses a state machine:
1. **Try native dialog first** - attempts `rfd::FileDialog::pick_folder()`
2. **Detect failure** - if dialog returns `None`, assume it failed
3. **Switch to manual mode** - shows text input with validation
4. **Validate path** - checks if path exists and is a directory
5. **Return result** - same API regardless of method used

This ensures the editor works seamlessly regardless of the environment!
