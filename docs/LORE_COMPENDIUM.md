# Eryndor Lore Compendium

A foundational, developer‑ready reference for worldbuilding, quests, narrative systems, and future text‑based experiences set in the world of Eryndor. This compendium is designed to be a living document that evolves as the game develops.

## World Overview

Eryndor is a classic high‑fantasy realm where medieval steel meets ancient magic. Kingdoms rise and fall by the sword, archers shape the outcomes of wars, and mages wield elemental, shadow, and divine forces. Feudal politics, secret orders, and prophecy thread through everyday life. Adventurers embody archetypal roles—tanks, damage‑dealers, and healers—while the world balances between chaos and hope.

Technology remains medieval (steel, bows, siege engines), while magic permeates every stratum of society. The interplay of steel and sorcery is central to Eryndor’s identity and gameplay.

## Historical Timeline (Highlights)

Dates are listed relative to the Unification of Eryndor under the House of Eryngard. Historians commonly divide eras into “Before Unification (B.U.)” and “After Unification (A.U.).” The current year is approximately 500 A.U.

- Ancient Era — Age of Legends (pre‑history): Myth holds that gods and dragons shaped the continents, leaving behind enchanted ruins and cursed artifacts. A primordial cataclysm scorched the land now called Dragon’s Hollow and seeded early prophecies of a “Chosen Era.”
- 0 A.U. — The Unification: A seaborne war‑leader united fractured realms into the Kingdom of Eryngard. Fortresses rose at river crossings and passes; land grants established a new feudal order. The courtly tongue and customs of the new rulers became the realm’s high culture.
- 100 A.U. — The Dragonfall War: Dragons returned from long exile. The greatest fell over the central valley, its death‑fires carving out Dragon’s Hollow. A divine covenant bound dragonkind, ending open war but leaving scarred lands and scattered cults.
- 200 A.U. — The Schism of Faith and Magic: After a deadly arcane disaster near Greenglade, the Edicts of Everdeep were proclaimed: divine magic under the Church’s oversight; elemental magic under licensed guilds; shadow magic restricted to sanctioned and closely monitored study.
- 350 A.U. — The Greenglade Rebellion: Heirs of the old forest‑kings rose against the crown. The uprising ended at Knight’s Rest in a pyrrhic victory for the monarchy. The region has never forgotten.
- 450 A.U. — The Prophecy of the Everdeep: An Oracle on Sanctuary Isle foretold: “When Everdeep runs dry and a twin‑tailed comet scars the sky, the last blood of the old king shall raise the sword, and the shadow within shall die.” The signs have not yet come to pass.
- 500 A.U. — Present Day: Rumors of an eastern horde, shadow‑creatures near Dragon’s Hollow, and a whispered heir of Greenglade strain a young king’s rule. The stage is set for steel, spell, and destiny.

## Kingdoms, Factions, and Powers

### Nations & Peoples
- **Kingdom of Eryngard:** The dominant human realm. Strengths: knightly orders, centralized law, five centuries of precedent. Weaknesses: vassal unrest, prophecy panic, factional intrigue.
- **Greenglade Clans:** Semi‑autonomous forest nobility and village councils guided by druids. Legendary longbowmen and guerilla warfare tacticians.
- **Dwarves of Frostpeak (Kal Durim):** Isolationist master smiths and miners, honor‑bound allies against common threats.
- **Elves of Loranor:** Reclusive stewards of ancient groves and standing stones; speak in riddles, act with long sight.
- **Free Cities & Minor Realms:** Everdeep Landing (neutral), Shattered Coast (pirates), steppe clans to the east, hidden halfling vales.

### Organizations & Orders
- **Holy Church of Light:** Healers, paladins, and Templars of the Radiant Blade. Seeks unity and purity; divided between zeal and mercy.
- **Arcane Circle (Mage Guild):** Licensed study of elemental arts. At odds with the Church over forbidden research.

- **Loremasters’ Guild:** Neutral scholars/enchanters who preserve truth through Chronicle Crystals (see “Lore Master Profession”).

## Magic and Adventuring Roles

- **Fire Magic:** Destructive warfare and weapon‑forging. The Salamander Lodge trains fire‑vanguard knights.
- **Ice/Water Magic:** Control and defense; blizzards, walls, and restorative brews. Rune‑smiths inscribe frost sigils.
- **Shadow Magic:** Forbidden arts (necromancy, umbral curses, deep illusion). Powerful but corruptive.
- **Divine/Natural Magic:** Healing, blessings, smiting undead, and druidic nature rites.

Roles in parties mirror lore: stalwart guardians (tanks), swift strikers (DPS), and benevolent healers. Synergy of steel and spell is a core theme.

## Major Story Arcs (Modular)

- **War of the Crown:** A hidden claimant of Greenglade challenges the throne; diplomacy, sieges, and knightly politics shape the realm.
- **Shadow of the Abyss:** The Shadow Cabal seeks to rip open Dragon’s Hollow; undead musters, exorcisms, and ritual‑breaking.
- **Dragons’ Return:** Draconic stirrings and clutch‑sites prompt negotiations or war; choose between annihilation, pact, or balance.
- **The Arcane Schism:** Arcane accidents trigger witch‑hunts; players mediate between Church and Circle, exposing third‑party manipulation.
- **Beyond the Horizon (Hook):** Envoys from distant lands foreshadow new regions, cultures, and future expansions.

Arcs can intersect; outcomes can reshape regions and future content.

## The Lore Master Crafting Profession

Lore Masters of the Guild craft **Chronicle Crystals**—illusionary, interactive re‑enactments of historical events. Players collect memory‑fragments (letters, relics, echoes) to assemble chronicles such as the Battle of Knight’s Rest or episodes of the Dragonfall War.

- **Gameplay:** Chronicles act as instanced “historical scenarios” with rewards (cosmetics, lore reputation, leads to present‑day secrets).
- **Fiction:** The Guild’s neutrality (Codex of Truth) makes its chronicles widely trusted yet politically sensitive.
- **Text‑Based Integration:** Chronicles translate naturally into interactive fiction modules on web/mobile.

---

## Ongoing Development & Expandability

- **Evolving Timeline:** Add new A.U. entries as live events resolve (e.g., “501 A.U. — The Shadow War Broken at Dragon’s Hollow”).
- **Expanding Regions:** Seeded hooks support future areas (island kingdoms, eastern steppes, under‑mountain realms).
- **New Factions & Races:** Introduce orcs, dragonkin, or foreign cults with lore roots already planted.
- **Interactive Adventures:** Region sections serve as hubs for text adventures; chronicles power seasonal story content.
- **Living Document:** Append new sections without overhaul; preserve developer‑friendly structure for quest scripting.

---

## Design Notes for Quest Writers

- Tie class archetypes to orders (e.g., Silver Dawn for tanks, Templars for healer‑paladins, Salamander Lodge for fire DPS).
- Use regional tensions (Eryngard vs. Greenglade; Church vs. Circle) to frame moral choices without binary good/evil.
- Leverage prophecy sparingly; each hint should progress a tangible, local story beat.
- Chronicle Crystals are perfect for tutorials, retrospectives, and holiday events.
