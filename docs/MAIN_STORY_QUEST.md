# The Everdeep Prophecy — Main Story Questline (MSQ)

## Overview
**The Everdeep Prophecy** is a defining, world‑altering main story questline (MSQ) for **Eryndor**. It spans **Eryngard**, **Frostpeak**, **Dragon’s Hollow**, **Knight’s Rest**, **Lake Everdeep**, and **Greenglade**. The narrative centers on a looming magical catastrophe tied to the **Prophecy of the Everdeep** and the reawakening of an ancient evil beneath the lake. Political tension—between the **Holy Church of Light** and the **Arcane Circle**, and a **contested succession**—intertwines with the threat. The MSQ is designed for **solo and group play** (FFXIV‑style duties), with **manageable branching**: flavored paths that converge, plus a final bifurcated ending.

**Core themes:** *legacy, power, sacrifice,* and the tension/union of **Light and Magic**.

**Player roles supported:** tanks, DPS, and healers across martial and magical archetypes (fire, ice, shadow, divine; swords, bows, maces, daggers).

---

## Key Factions & Premise

- **Prophecy of the Everdeep.** When shadows return to Dragon’s Hollow and the depths stir, a darkness sealed by kings and light shall rise again. Unity of the land’s legacy is the key.
- **Ancient Evil — Zal’gurath, the Everdeep Shadow.** A primordial shadow‑dragon/demon bound beneath Lake Everdeep by the First King with Church and mage heroes. The **Shadow Cabal** seeks to break the seal through dispersed rituals.
- **Holy Church of Light.** High Priestess **Mariana** leads paladins and clergy; protective, traditional, wary of arcane excess.
- **Arcane Circle.** Archmage **Solandir** leads sanctioned mages; pragmatic, research‑driven, frustrated by Church secrecy.
- **Contested Heirs.** **Prince Alric** (Church‑favored, pious traditionalist) vs **Princess Elyana** (Arcane‑backed, brilliant mage). Their rivalry threatens unity as the prophecy unfolds.
- **Regional Allies.** **Elves of Greenglade** (Elder **Aranel**), **Dwarves of Frostpeak** (King/Jarl **Thulgar/Sten**), **Knights of Knight’s Rest** (Lord Commander **Davos**), veteran **Captain Roland**, paladin **Sir Garrick**, and scholar **Magus Lirien**.

## Structure at a Glance

```
Act I  : The Gathering Shadow (Eryngard → Dragon’s Hollow edge)
          Decision 1: Path of Faith (Greenglade) OR Path of Knowledge (Frostpeak)

Act II : Paths Divided, Destiny Unified
          Branch A (Faith): Shrine of Everdawn → Dawnsblade + Elven alliance
          Branch B (Knowledge): Kar’Thulim Ruins → Everdeep Grimoire + Dwarven alliance
          Converge: Siege of Knight’s Rest
          Decision 2: Choose a Regent (Alric OR Elyana)

Act III: Twilight of the Everdeep (Lake Everdeep warfront)
          Multi‑phase battle; optional strike on Dragon’s Hollow conduit
          Xathos defeated; Zal’gurath awakens

Act IV : Legacy of Light and Shadow (Everdeep Citadel finale)
          Decision 3: Seal with Sacrifice OR Destroy with Dangerous Magic
          Epilogues & world state updates
```

Branching is **flavor + perspective** through Act II; Acts III–IV converge with **two primary endings** (plus an optional unity “golden route” if desired).

---

## ACT I — The Gathering Shadow

**Scope:** Onboarding to prophecy, factions, and the Cabal. Solo story instance + first 4‑player dungeon.

**Key Locations**
- **Eryngard City:** Royal funeral and council at Grand Cathedral & Arcane Spire.
- **Border Outpost (Dragon’s Hollow rim):** First signs of shadow incursions.

**Major NPCs**
Mariana (High Priestess), Solandir (Archmage), Prince Alric, Princess Elyana, Captain Roland (mentor), Cabal agent(s).

**Beats**
1. **Funeral Eclipse (Solo Instance).** A sudden darkness shrouds Eryngard; Cabal assassins strike. The player thwarts theft of a relic and saves a claimant.
2. **Council of Eryngard.** Prophecy revealed; Church vs Circle strategies clash. Player appointed **Envoy of the Throne**.
3. **Caverns of Hollowshade (4‑player Dungeon).** Disrupt a Cabal ritual, learn of **Zal’gurath** and multi‑site weakening of the seal.
4. **Decision 1.**  
   - **Path of Faith (Greenglade):** Retrieve a holy relic and win Elven alliance.  
   - **Path of Knowledge (Frostpeak):** Retrieve arcane lore/artifact and win Dwarven alliance.

---

## ACT II — Paths Divided, Destiny Unified

Two parallel chapter experiences that **rejoin** at Knight’s Rest. Players do **one** path per playthrough; both yield the tools and alliances needed.

### Branch A — Path of Faith (Greenglade)

**Focus:** Worthiness, tradition, nature’s pact.

**Locations:** Greenglade villages (shadow‑blight), **Elven Court**, **Shrine of Everdawn** (dungeon).

**NPCs:** Sir **Garrick** (paladin), Elder **Aranel** (elf), recurring Cabal assassin.

**Flow**
- Aid blight‑struck hamlets; expose Cabal ward‑breaking rites.
- **Elven Court Trial.** Dialogue checks around humility, stewardship, unity.
- **Shrine of Everdawn (Dungeon).** Trials + Cabal intrusion; acquire **Dawnsblade** (holy sword/imbuement). Elves pledge aid.

### Branch B — Path of Knowledge (Frostpeak)

**Focus:** Pragmatism, curiosity’s cost, ancient engineering.

**Locations:** Frostpeak passes, mining settlement, **Kal Durim** stronghold, **Kar’Thulim Ruins** (dungeon).

**NPCs:** **Magus Lirien** (scholar), **Thulgar/Sten** (dwarf leader), Cabal sorcerer **Maltrius**.

**Flow**
- Rescue miners; quell cursed undead; cure dwarven malady via runes/alchemy.
- Parley earns access to ruins; dwarves pledge warriors.
- **Kar’Thulim (Dungeon).** Arcane puzzles + Maltrius boss; recover **Everdeep Grimoire** (and/or crystal). Optional: caution or indulge Lirien’s risky spell (flavor).

### Convergence — Siege of Knight’s Rest (8‑player Trial/Scenario)

**Set‑piece:** Shadow Cabal besieges the fortress to kill the Envoy and seize relics.
- Objectives: defend gates, man ballistas v. shadow drakes, evacuate civilians.
- **Choice (minor):** Which crisis to address first (influences which allied squad survives).
- **Climax:** **Xathos**, Cabal grand summoner, duels the player; **Captain Roland** sacrifices himself to save a claimant. Xathos retreats, gloating the Everdeep rite nears completion.

**Decision 2 — Choose a Regent**
- **Alric** (Church‑led unity: honor, fortification, morale).  
- **Elyana** (Arcane‑led unity: strategy, barriers, innovation).  
Both continue to work together; choice flavors commands and scenes in Acts III–IV.

---

## ACT III — Twilight of the Everdeep

**Scope:** Warfront campaign around Lake Everdeep; optional strike in Dragon’s Hollow; Xathos defeated; Zal’gurath awakens.

**Locations:** Lake Everdeep shoreline camps, **Everdeep Isle**, optional **Hollow Conduit** strike.

**Allies Present:** Regent (chosen), Mariana, Solandir, Aranel, Thulgar/Sten, Sir Garrick / Magus Lirien (survival varies), Lord Commander Davos.

**Phases**
1. **Mustering & Morale.** Preparations, cross‑faction coordination, quiet character moments before the storm.
2. **Battle of Everdeep (Multi‑stage).**
   - **Field Battle:** Push back shadow legions; siege weapon objectives; rescue operations.
   - **Branching Priority (timed flavor):**
     - **A.** Strike the **Hollow Conduit** (solo/4‑player) to weaken the ritual.
     - **B.** Save a threatened settlement/column. Order affects casualties and NPC presence later.
   - **Assault on Everdeep Isle (4‑player Trial).**  
     Boss: **Grand Summoner Xathos** (partially empowered). Defeated—yet the seal shatters.
3. **Awakening.** Cinematic: **Zal’gurath** rises from the lake; sky blackens; Act ends on a cliffhanger.

**Character Sacrifices (examples)**
- Sir Garrick saves Lirien (or vice versa), one may fall depending on prior choices.
- Solandir expends life‑force to shield the army—unless arcane crystal present.
- Mariana shields refugees and is gravely wounded but survives (or her second takes mantle).

---

## ACT IV — Legacy of Light and Shadow

**Scope:** Final dungeon/trial in the **Everdeep Citadel**; ultimate resolution; epilogues & world‑state.

**Final Instance:** **Heart of Everdeep** (8‑player Trial; story‑mode scalable)
- **Stage 1:** Gauntlet through shadow‑veils using **Dawnsblade** and ritual nodes powered via **Grimoire**.
- **Stage 2:** **Zal’gurath** boss fight with relic‑driven vulnerability phases.
- **Culmination:** The foe is broken—how to end it?

### Decision 3 — The Ending

1. **Seal with Sacrifice (Light’s Rite).**  
   Perform the binding rite; requires life of royal blood. The Regent offers themself. Zal’gurath is sealed; world saved; bittersweet memorial.

2. **Destroy with Dangerous Magic (Arcane Gambit).**  
   Overload relics to annihilate Zal’gurath. No life sacrifice—but a catastrophic shockwave scars Lake Everdeep’s region; victory with lingering costs.

3. **(Optional Golden Route) Unity Purification.**  
   If prior reconciliations & survivals are met, unite Light and Magic to **purify** the shadow without sacrifice or cataclysm. Rare, celebratory outcome.

## Epilogues & World State

**If Sealed (Sacrifice)**
- Mourning in **Eryngard**; the surviving claimant crowned; Church venerates the martyr.
- **Everdeep Shrine** rebuilt; relics interred as renewed ward.
- Shadow Cabal remnants pivot to breaking the *new* seal (post‑MSQ hooks).

**If Destroyed (Power)**
- **Everdeep** geography altered (drained lake/fissures/storms).  
- Regent rules; Arcane prestige rises; Church uneasy.  
- Magical fallout quests: awakened elementals, unstable leylines, foreign interest.

**If Unity (Golden)**
- Land **heals** around Everdeep; co‑rule or reformed council established.  
- Harmony of Church & Circle; new threats teased beyond Eryndor.

**Persistent Changes (phased/instanced)**
- Lake Everdeep zone variant per ending.
- Throne room ruler reflects **Decision 2**.
- NPC dialogue acknowledges saved/ lost allies and Act III priority choices.
- Cabal epilogues as side chains.

## Implementation Notes (Branching Manageability)

- **Branching Pattern:** Early **A/B** path (Greenglade/Frostpeak) → **Converge** → Leadership flavor (Alric/Elyana) → **Final A/B ending** (Seal/Destroy).  
- **Content Parity:** Branch A & B target similar scope & rewards.  
- **Outcome Tracking:**  
  - `msq_path` ∈ {faith, knowledge}  
  - `regent` ∈ {alric, elyana}  
  - `everdeep_end` ∈ {sealed, destroyed, unity(optional)}  
  - Minor flags: `saved_elven_scouts`, `saved_dwarven_vanguard`, `lirien_tempted`, etc.  
- **World Phasing:** Throne room ruler, Everdeep zone variant, NPC banter sets.  
- **Replayability:** New Game+ style replays can expose the other Act II branch without altering canonical flags (or via alt characters).

---

## Future Hooks

- **Foreign Powers** test Eryndor after the Everdeep crisis.  
- **Cabal Splinters** vie for forbidden relics.  
- **Arcane‑Church Concordat** story patches (reforms, inquisitions, or joint council).  
- **Dragon Threads:** Eggs or drakes stirred by Everdeep shock.
